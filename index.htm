 <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>These massive opportunities are why our organizations, together with existing and new partners, is transforming the way we work. We will drive powerful and influential partnerships, innovative solutions, sustainable financing, in-depth monitoring and large-scale mobilization of people.

From numerous initiatives, priority areas and priority species, the entire network will focus on six major goals - forests, oceans, wildlife, food, climate & energy, and freshwater – and three key drivers of environmental problems – markets, finance and governance.

As a Network, we will organize ourselves around communities of practice with one for each goal and driver. We are becoming more focused and more targeted in our efforts, while building on the interconnectedness of each of these issues within the global agenda. Our Organization with our partners will bring the weight of its unique local-to-global Network to bear and drive these issues forward cohesively.</p>

 <h3>Importance</h3>
 <p>We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can.

But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow.

So by saving pandas, we will also be saving so much more. We will be helping to protect not only these unique forests but also the wealth of species that live in them, such as dwarf blue sheep and beautiful multi-coloured pheasants.

And we will be providing a lifeline for a host of other endangered animals, including the golden snub-nosed monkey, takin and crested ibis that share these magnificent forests with the panda.

The panda’s habitat is also important for the livelihoods of local communities, who use it for food, income, fuel for cooking and heating, and medicine. And for people across the country.

The panda's mountains form the watersheds for both the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, which are the economic heart of China – home to hundreds of millions of people. Economic benefits derived from these critical basins include tourism, subsistence fisheries and agriculture, transport, hydropower and water resources.

So by protecting pandas, we’re helping to safeguard the broader environment, which so many people and animals depend on.

Pandas themselves are also economically and culturally valuable. They are the national symbol of China and generate significant economic benefits for local communities through ecotourism and other activities.</p>

<p>  </p>
<p>Always free of charge and open 364 days a year, the Smithsonian’s National Zoo is one of Washington D.C.’s, and the Smithsonian’s, most popular tourist destinations, with more than 2 million visitors from all over the world each year. The Zoo instills a lifelong commitment to conservation through engaging experiences with animals and the people working to save them.Founded in 1889, the Zoo is part of the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum and research complex. Today, the Zoo sits on 163 acres in the heart of Washington, D.C.’s Rock Creek Park and is home to 2,700 animals representing more than 390 species.

The Zoo’s commitment to conservation, research, and education extends to the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, located in nearby Front Royal, Virginia. SCBI scientists and animal care experts conduct veterinary and reproductive research to save wildlife and habitats for some of the world’s most endangered animals on the sprawling 3,200-acre campus.

The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute leads the Smithsonian’s global effort to save species, better understand ecosystems, and train future generations of conservationists. Scientists from the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute also work in field stations around the world. More than 200 scientists and their partners in more than 30 countries create and share knowledge to aid in the survival and recovery of species and their habitats. Findings from these studies provide critical data for the management of captive populations and valuable insights for the conservation and management of wild populations.</p>

<p>  </p>
<p>The Dujiangyan Panda Base is an hour and a half outside Sichuan’s capital of Chengdu, making it a prime spot for panda encounters since it’s easily accessible to tourists. This center boasts an interactive experience not offered at any other branches of the Wolong Nature Reserve’s network: the Panda Keeper Program, also known as the best babysitting gig in the world. Travelers can assist caretakers in their day-to-day work, which involves waking the pandas up, cleaning the enclosures, and preparing a feast of bamboo for meals and snacks of steamed buns and apples. During your visit, make sure to peer into the base’s panda playground, particularly in the morning when China’s animal ambassadors are at their most active.</p>

 <h3>Impact</h3>
 <p>The good news is that giant panda numbers are increasing. Slowly but surely this remarkable species is edging away from the brink of extinction - thanks to a host of successful conservation projects.

But pandas still face a number of threats, particularly habitat loss and fragmentation, so extra efforts are needed to ensure that they continue to survive and thrive.

Creating new reserves and linking up existing panda populations are key to the species' future. The Chinese authorities have increased the number of panda reserves to 67 in recent years, but this still leaves around 1/3rd of wild pandas outside protected areas.

The Chinese government, in partnership with WWF, has also developed bamboo corridors to link pockets of forest, allowing the pandas within them to move to new areas, find more food and meet more potential breeding mates.

But with panda habitat continuing to be fragmented by roads, railways and other human development, additional corridors will be needed to connect isolated panda populations.

<h3> Trusted Partners</h3>
<p>Besides using less paper or reducing travel impact, there is always the choice to donate to organzations that devote their time to save these creature. </p>

Nature reserve protection to ensure that the reserve borders are patrolled and no illegal hunting or logging takes place inside them
Community development projects such as providing wood saving stoves to limit the impact of wood-fuel harvesting on the panda's forests.
Research and monitoring work, such as setting up infrared cameras to record panda movements in the Minshan and Qinling Mountains.</p>
